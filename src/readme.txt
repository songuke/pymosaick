1. sift.py implementation is by Jan Erik Solem and available online at:
http://www.janeriksolem.net/2009/02/sift-python-implementation.html

I fixed some bugs in sift.py and adapted it for use with ImageMosaick.

sift.py basically calls siftWin32.exe to detect feature points. siftWin32.exe is
provided on SIFT's author's website.

2. ImageMosaick.py: main file of image mosaick implementation.
